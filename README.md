# Exolaination 
**LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).**
LangChain is a Python library that allows developers to build applications that utilize the capabilities of large language models.
LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:
    **Development:** Build your applications using LangChain's open-source building blocks, components, and third-party integrations. Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
    **Deployment:** Deploy your applications to the cloud or on-premises using LangChain's cloud,
    Turn your **LangGraph** applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Cloud.
