# **LangChain v.0.3**

Our objective is to become **world-class experts** in **LangChain**. Ideally, we should learn it by running it on **Google Colab** with a model installed. This will allow all our students to **learn for free**. However, we will start by using **Google Gemini APIs** because it is easy to use and almost free. [Check out the pricing](#).
